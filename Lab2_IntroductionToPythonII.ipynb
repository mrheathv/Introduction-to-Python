All the variables you create: integers, lists, dictionaries — these are all Python objects, and Python knows how to clean them up when it's done with them. Since your files exist outside your Python script, we need to tell Python when we're done with them so that it can close the connection to that file. Leaving a file connection open unnecessarily can affect performance or impact other programs on your computer that might be trying to access that file.\n",

    "Python offers a whole suite of magic methods a class can implement that will allow us to use the same syntax as Python's built-in data types. You can write functionality that allows custom defined types to behave like lists:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class UserGroup:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, users, permissions):\n",
    "    self.user_list = users\n",
    "    self.permissions = permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "  def __iter__(self):\n",
    "    return iter(self.user_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "  def __len__(self):\n",
    "    return len(self.user_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "  def __contains__(self, user):\n",
    "    return user in self.user_list\n",
    "```\n",
    "In our UserGroup class above we defined three methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__`, our constructor, which sets a list of users to the instance variable self.user_list and sets the group's permissions when we create a new UserGroup.\n",
    "- `__iter__`, the iterator, we use the iter() function to turn the list self.user_list into an iterator so we can use for user in user_group syntax. For more information on iterators, review [Python's documentation of Iterator Types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typeiter).\n",
    "- `__len__`, the length method, so when we call len(user_group) it will return the length of the underlying self.user_list list.\n",
    "- `__contains__`, the check for containment, allows us to use user in user_group syntax to check if a User exists in the user_list we have.\n",
    "These methods allow UserGroup to act like a list using syntax Python programmers will already be familiar with. If all you need is something to act like a list you could absolutely have used a list, but if you want to bundle some other information (like a group's permissions, for instance) having syntax that allows for list-like operations can be very powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would be able to use the following code to do this, for example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class User:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, username):\n",
    "    self.username = username\n",
    "\n",
    "diana = User('diana')\n",
    "frank = User('frank')\n",
    "jenn = User('jenn')\n",
    "\n",
