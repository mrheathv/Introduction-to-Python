    "Do you have a gigantic string that you need to parse for information? Do you need to sanitize a users input to work in a function? Do you need to be able to generate outputs with variable values? All of these things can be accomplished with string methods!\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes with built-in string methods that gives you the power to perform complicated tasks on strings very quickly and efficiently. These string methods allow you to change the case of a string, split a string into many smaller strings, join many small strings together into a larger string, and allow you to neatly combine changing variables with string outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson, you worked len(), which was a function that determined the number of characters in a string. This, while similar, was NOT a string method. String methods all have the same syntax:\n",

    "Unlike len(), which is called with a string as it's argument, a string method is called at the end of a string and each one has its own method specific arguments."

    "## .format()\n",
    "Python also provides a handy string method for including variables in strings. This method is .format(). .format() takes variables as an argument and includes them in the string that it is run on. You include {} marks as placeholders for where those variables will be imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def favorite_song_statement(song, artist):\n",
    "  return \"My favorite song is {} by {}.\".format(song, artist)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The function favorite_song_statement takes two arguments, song and artist, then returns the a string that includes both of the arguments and prints a sentence. Note: .format() can take as many arguments are there are {} in the string it is run on, which in this case in two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of the function being run:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> favorite_song_statement(\"Smooth\", \"Santana\")\n",
    "\"My favorite song is Smooth by Santana\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now you may be asking yourself, I could have written this function using string concatenation instead of .format(), why is this method better? The answer is legibility and reusability. It is much easier to picture the end result .format() than it is to picture the end result of string concatenation and legibility is everything. You can also reuse the same base string with different variables, allowing you to cut down on unnecessary, hard to interpret code."

    ".format() can be made even more legible for other people reading your code by including keywords.

You can even reverse the order of artist and song in the code above and it will work the same way. This makes writing AND reading the code much easier."

    "In the world of programming, a great deal of emphasis is placed on making code reusable. In most cases, we write code so that it can be reusable by ourselves. But sometimes we share code that's helpful across a broad range of situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll explore how to use tools other people have built in Python that are not included automatically for you when you install Python. Python allows us to package code into files or sets of files called modules.\n",

A namespace isolates the functions, classes, and variables defined in the module from the code in the file doing the importing. Your local namespace, meanwhile, is where your code is run.\n",

This syntax is considered dangerous because it could pollute our local namespace. Pollution occurs when the same name could apply to two possible things. For example, if you happen to have a function `floor()` focused on floor tiles, using from math import * would also import a function floor() that rounds down floats.\n",

    "3. Each key: value pair (i.e., `\"oatmeal\": 3` or \"avocado `toast\": 6`) is separated by a comma (`,`)\n",

    "## What's With \"with\"?\n",
    "We've been opening these files with this with block so far, but it seems a little weird that we can only use our file variable in the indented block. Why is that? The with keyword invokes something called a context manager for the file that we're calling open() on. This context manager takes care of opening the file when we call open() and then closing the file after we leave the indented block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is closing the file so complicated? Well, most other aspects of our code deal with things that Python itself controls. All the variables you create: integers, lists, dictionaries — these are all Python objects, and Python knows how to clean them up when it's done with them. Since your files exist outside your Python script, we need to tell Python when we're done with them so that it can close the connection to that file. Leaving a file connection open unnecessarily can affect performance or impact other programs on your computer that might be trying to access that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The with syntax replaces older ways to access files where you need to call .close() on the file object manually. We can still open up a file and append to it with the old syntax, as long as we remember to close the file connection afterwards.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fun_cities_file = open('fun_cities.txt', 'a')\n",

    "# But we need to remember to close the file\n",
    "fun_cities_file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above script we added \"Montréal\" as a new line in our file fun_cities.txt. However, since we used the older-style syntax, we had to remember to close the file afterwards. Since this is necessarily more verbose (requires at least one more line of code) without being any more expressive, using with is preferred."

Flexibility in programming is a broad philosophy, but what's worth remembering is that we want to implement forms that are familiar in our programs so that usage is expected. For example, let's think of the + operator. It's easy to think of it as a single function that \"adds\" whatever is on the left with whatever is on the right, but it does many different things in different contexts:\n",
